In today's complex distributed systems, unexpected failures can result in significant downtime and revenue loss. Traditional testing methods often fall short in identifying all potential failure points, particularly under conditions of high load or network instability. Chaos engineering addresses this gap by proactively testing system resilience, ensuring that applications can withstand and recover from real-world disruptions.
