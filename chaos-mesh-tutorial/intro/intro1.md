In today's complex distributed systems, unexpected failures can result in significant downtime and revenue loss. Traditional testing methods often fall short in identifying all potential failure points, particularly under conditions of high load or network instability. **Chaos engineering** addresses this gap by proactively testing system resilience, ensuring that applications can withstand and recover from real-world disruptions.

But what exactly is chaos engineering? **Chaos engineering** is a disciplined approach to identifying and mitigating system failures by intentionally introducing controlled disruptions into your infrastructure. By simulating real-world failure scenarios, chaos engineering enables teams to observe how their applications behave under stress, ultimately building robustness and resilience against unforeseen issues.
One powerful tool in this space is **Chaos Mesh**, an open-source chaos engineering platform designed specifically for Kubernetes environments. Chaos Mesh enables developers and operators to inject various types of faults such as network issues, CPU and memory stress, and more to test the resilience and stability of their applications.

### Intended Learning Outcomes
By the end of this tutorial, you will:
1. Understand the fundamentals of Chaos Engineering and its importance in enhancing system resilience.
2. Deploy a sample Istio-managed application on a Kubernetes cluster using KillerKoda.
3. Install and configure **Chaos Mesh** for simulating failure scenarios.
4. Execute two types of chaos experiments: **PodChaos** and **NetworkChaos**.
5. Analyze the effects and results of the experiments.

Let's start!
